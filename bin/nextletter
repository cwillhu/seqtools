Hi all,

The fastq files with the read sequences of run $run are available at:

https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/ngsdata/$run

or under /n/ngsdata/$run on the cluster.

Summary statistics can be found at:

https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/ngsdata/$run/Reports/html/$dirname/all/all/all/laneBarcode.html

Reads with indices not in SampleSheet.csv are in the fastq file labeled 
\"Undetermined_S0.\" We encourage users to download a local copy of their 
data, as run data will eventually be removed from the ngsdata server.

Best,
Chris
