Hi all,

The fastq files with the read sequences of run $run are available at:

https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/ngsdata/$run

or under /n/ngsdata/$run on the cluster.

Summary statistics can be found in Basecall_Stats/Demultiplex_Stats.htm. Reads 
with indices not in the SampleSheet are in the fastq file(s) labeled \"Undetermined.\"

We encourage users to download a local copy of their data, as run data will
eventually be removed from the ngsdata server.

Best,
Chris
