Note on setting of NextSeq bcl2fastq2 parameter --minimum-trimmed-read-length 
(which corresponds to seqprep parameter --minTrimmedReadLength):
  When using the --use-bases-mask option, this option must be manually set to be 
  less than or equal to the minimum read length. Otherwise, bcl2fastq 2.15.0 will 
  N-pad the reads to the default minimum trimmed read length of 32 basepairs.

  More information about this bug is in the release notes:
  http://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/software_documentation/bcl2fastq/bcl2fastq2-v2.15.0-customer-release-notes-15053886-b.pdf
  As a workaround, SeqPrep passes a value of 0 to bcl2fastq2 for the minimum
  trimmed read length. To disable this parameter, change is default value to 
  None in SeqPrep's settings.py.
